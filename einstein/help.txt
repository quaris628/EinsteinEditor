 How to get a .bb8 file from a simulation
--------------------------------

Select a bibite (left-click on it)
Click "Stats Panel" (far upper-left button with a bar graph)
"Save"
Give it a name. Description is optional.
Do NOT select "Save as template". (This box should be UNchecked.)
"Save"

This will save it to the simulation's "Bibites" folder.
Einstein should automatically open to this "Bibites" folder when loading and saving.
If you need to see where this folder is (e.g. so you can copy a .bb8 file to/from it), you can click on "Open save folder" (big up-arrow icon) to open this folder in the file explorer.

(It's possible newer versions will have a different process.)

 How to put a .bb8 file into a simulation
--------------------------------

Click the far bottom-left petri dish button
"Place Bibite"
"Saved Bibites" (second-to-the-left button along the top, with the bibite and up arrow icons)

This will display a list of .bb8 files from the simulation's "Bibites" folder.
Einstein should automatically open to this "Bibites" folder when loading and saving.
If you need to see where this folder is (e.g. so you can copy a .bb8 file to/from it), you can click on "Open save folder" (big up-arrow icon) to open this folder in the file explorer.

Select a bibite from this list
Left-click to place the bibites

(It's possible newer versions will have a different process.)

 How to run Einstein
--------------------------------

Open the /bin/ folder
Run Einstein.exe

Note: Windows will warn you about running this file because I'm not a verified publisher. You'll just have to trust me that I didn't write anything malicious in this.
If you want a shortcut on your desktop, right-click Einstein.exe in the file explorer > "Send To" > "Desktop (Create Shortcut)"

 I found a bug!

(with Einstein, not the bibites simulation.)

 Misc.
--------------------------------

Einstein can't read .bb8template files. Unfortunately their data and its format have significant inconsistencies that I haven't been able to figure out.
